   # GitHub Actions Workflow: SELENIUM and JMETER

   ## Overview
   This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build a .NET application (PartsUnlimited), deploy it
   to a development environment, and run JMeter load tests. The workflow combines continuous
   integration and performance testing in a single pipeline.

   ## Triggers
   The workflow is triggered by:
   - **Push events** to the `master` branch
   - **Pull request events** targeting the `master` branch
   - **Manual trigger** via `workflow_dispatch`

   ## Environment Variables
   The workflow uses several environment variables:
   - `Solution_Name`: 'PartsUnlimited.sln' - The .NET solution file
   - `buildPlatform`: 'Any CPU' - Target platform for compilation
   - `buildConfiguration`: 'Release' - Build configuration
   - `PACKAGE_LOCATION`: c:\PartsUnlimited - Where the build package is stored
   - `ARTIFACTS_DOWNLOAD`: C:\Artifacts\PartsUnlimited - Download location for artifacts
   - `WEB_SITE_NAME`: PartsUnlimited - IIS web application name

   ## Jobs

   ### Job 1: `build`
   **Purpose**: Builds the .NET application and prepares JMeter test files
   **Runner**: `windows-2019`

   #### Steps:
   1. **Checkout Code** (`actions/checkout@v2`)
      - Downloads the repository source code to the runner

   2. **Setup NuGet** (`NuGet/setup-nuget@v1.0.5`)
      - Configures NuGet package manager for dependency management

   3. **Restore Packages**
      - Runs `nuget restore` to download and install project dependencies

   4. **Setup MSBuild** (`microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.0.2`)
      - Configures Microsoft Build Engine for compiling .NET applications

   5. **Build using MSBuild**
      - Compiles the solution with specific parameters:
        - Platform: Any CPU
        - Configuration: Release
        - Creates deployment package
        - Outputs to `PACKAGE_LOCATION`

   6. **Copy JMeter Files**
      - Copies JMeter test files to the package location:
        - `LoadTest.jmx` - JMeter test plan
        - `jtl_junit_converter.py` - Script to convert JMeter results to JUnit format

   7. **Publish Artifacts**
      - Uploads the build package and JMeter files as artifacts named "JMeter"

   ### Job 2: `dev`
   **Purpose**: Deploys the application and runs performance tests
   **Dependencies**: Requires `build` job to complete successfully
   **Environment**: `dev` environment
   **Runner**: `jmeter-test` (custom/self-hosted runner)

   #### Steps:
   1. **Download Build Artifact**
      - Downloads the "JMeter" artifact from the build job
      - Places files in a run-specific directory using `github.run_number`

   2. **Run MSDeploy.exe**
      - Deploys the web application using Microsoft Web Deploy
      - Synchronizes the package to IIS
      - Configures the web application name
      - Uses DoNotDeleteRule to preserve existing files

   3. **Run JMeter**
      - Executes JMeter load test in non-GUI mode (`-n`)
      - Uses the LoadTest.jmx test plan (`-t`)
      - Outputs results to a .jtl file (`-l`)

   4. **Convert JMeter Results to JUnit**
      - Runs Python script to convert JMeter .jtl results to JUnit XML format
      - This enables integration with CI/CD reporting tools

   5. **Publish Test Results**
      - Uploads the converted JUnit XML file as "JMeterTestFile" artifact
      - Allows for test result analysis and reporting

   ## Workflow Characteristics

   ### Strengths:
   - **Automated CI/CD**: Combines build, deployment, and testing
   - **Performance Testing**: Includes automated load testing with JMeter
   - **Artifact Management**: Proper handling of build and test artifacts
   - **Environment Isolation**: Uses specific environment for deployment

   ### Areas for Improvement:
   - **Action Versions**: Uses older versions of GitHub Actions (v1.0.0, v2)
   - **Error Handling**: Limited error handling and cleanup steps
   - **Security**: Hardcoded paths and potential credential exposure
   - **Parallel Execution**: Sequential job execution may slow down pipeline

   ## Use Case
   This workflow is ideal for:
   - .NET web applications requiring performance validation
   - Teams practicing continuous deployment with quality gates
   - Applications where load testing is critical before production deployment

   # Windows Services Release Workflow Documentation

   ## Overview

   This GitHub Actions workflow automates the build and deployment of a Windows service
   application. It implements a two-stage CI/CD pipeline that builds the application using MSBuild
   and deploys it to a self-hosted Windows runner.

   ## Workflow Configuration

   ### Triggers
   The workflow is triggered by:
   - **Push events** to the `master` branch
   - **Pull request events** targeting the `master` branch
   - **Manual dispatch** via the GitHub UI (`workflow_dispatch`)

   ### Environment Variables
   Global environment variables used throughout the workflow:

   | Variable | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` | `c:\myapp` | Build output directory |
   | `SERVICE_NAME` | `SampleWindowsServicesGHA` | Name of the Windows service |
   | `SERVICE_DIRECTORYNAME` | `C:\Services` | Target deployment directory |
   | `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY` | `C:\ServicesDownload` | Temporary download location for artifacts |

   ## Jobs

   ### 1. Build Job

   **Purpose**: Compiles the .NET solution and creates deployment artifacts

   **Runner**: `self-hosted` (Windows)

   #### Environment Variables
   - `Solution_Name`: `SampleWindowsServicesGHA.sln`
   - `buildPlatform`: `Any CPU`
   - `buildConfiguration`: `Release`

   #### Steps

   1. **Checkout** (`actions/checkout@v2`)
      - Retrieves the source code from the repository

   2. **Setup NuGet.exe** (`NuGet/setup-nuget@v1.0.5`)
      - Configures NuGet package manager for the build environment

   3. **Restore Packages**
      - Executes: `nuget restore $env:Solution_Name`
      - Downloads and restores all NuGet package dependencies

   4. **Setup MSBuild** (`microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1.0.2`)
      - Configures MSBuild tools for compilation

   5. **Build using MSBuild**
      - Executes: `msbuild $env:Solution_Name /p:platform=$env:buildPlatform
   /p:Configuration=$env:buildConfiguration /p:OutputPath=${{ env.OUTPUT_DIRECTORY }}`
      - Compiles the solution in Release configuration for Any CPU platform
      - Outputs binaries to the specified output directory

   6. **Publish Artifacts** (`actions/upload-artifact@v1.0.0`)
      - Uploads build output as artifact named `windowsservices`
      - Source path: `${{ env.OUTPUT_DIRECTORY }}`

   ### 2. Deploy Job

   **Purpose**: Downloads artifacts and deploys the Windows service

   **Runner**: `self-hosted` (Windows)

   **Dependencies**: Requires successful completion of the `build` job

   #### Steps

   1. **Download Build Artifact** (`actions/download-artifact@v2.0.7`)
      - Downloads the `windowsservices` artifact
      - Extracts to: `${{ env.DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY }}\${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }}`

   2. **List Windows Services**
      - Shell: PowerShell (`pwsh`)
      - Executes: `Get-Service -Name ${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }}`
      - Verifies the service exists and displays its current status

   3. **Stop Windows Service**
      - Executes elevated PowerShell command to stop the service
      - Uses `Start-Process` with `-Verb RunAs` for administrator privileges
      - Implements polling loop to wait until service status is "Stopped"

   4. **Copy Windows Service Files**
      - Shell: PowerShell (`pwsh`)
      - Executes: `Copy-Item -Path ${{ env.DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY }}\${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }}\*
   -Destination ${{ env.SERVICE_DIRECTORYNAME }}\${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }} -Force`
      - Copies all files from download location to service directory
      - Uses `-Force` flag to overwrite existing files

   5. **Start Windows Service**
      - Shell: PowerShell (`pwsh`)
      - Executes elevated PowerShell command to start the service
      - Uses `Start-Process` with `-Verb RunAs` for administrator privileges
      - Implements polling loop to wait until service status is "Running"

   ```

   ## Key Features

   ### Security Considerations
   - Uses self-hosted runners for both build and deployment
   - Requires elevated privileges for service management operations
   - Implements proper service state verification before proceeding

   ### Reliability Features
   - **Dependency Management**: Deploy job only runs after successful build
   - **State Verification**: Checks service status before and after operations
   - **Polling Loops**: Waits for service state changes to complete
   - **Force Overwrite**: Ensures file updates are applied during deployment

   ### Error Handling
   - Service status verification prevents deployment to non-existent services
   - Polling loops ensure operations complete before proceeding
   - Elevated privilege execution for service management commands

   ## Potential Improvements

   1. **Add error handling** for service management operations
   2. **Implement rollback mechanism** in case of deployment failure
   3. **Add health checks** after service restart
   4. **Use more recent action versions** (some actions are using older versions)
   5. **Add notification steps** for deployment success/failure
   6. **Implement blue-green deployment** for zero-downtime updates

   ---

   This workflow provides a comprehensive CI/CD solution for Windows service deployment with proper
    build artifact management and service lifecycle handling. The use of self-hosted runners allows
    for direct interaction with Windows services while maintaining security through elevated
   privilege execution.

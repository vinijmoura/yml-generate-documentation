● I'll help you analyze the workflow content from stdin and create a detailed explanation with a
   Mermaid diagram. Let me first read the content from stdin.

✓ Read workflow content from stdin
   $ cat
   ↪ 1 line...
● Let me try reading with a timeout and check if there's any input available:

✓ Check for stdin input with timeout
   $ timeout 5 cat || echo "No input received from stdin"
   ↪ 2 lines...
● It appears that no content was provided via stdin. Could you please provide the workflow content
    that you'd like me to analyze? You can either:

   1. Pipe the workflow content to this conversation
   2. Paste the workflow content directly in your message
   3. Specify the file path if the workflow is saved in a file

   Once I receive the workflow content, I'll be able to provide:

   - A detailed explanation of the workflow in Markdown format
   - Description of all stages, jobs, and steps
   - A Mermaid diagram representing the workflow structure

   Please share the workflow content you'd like me to analyze.

‚óè I'd be happy to analyze a workflow for you! However, I don't see any workflow file content or
   attached images in your message. Could you please provide:

   1. The workflow file content (YAML/YML file), or
   2. An attached image of the workflow, or
   3. The path to the workflow file in the repository

   Once you share the workflow details, I'll create a detailed markdown explanation covering:
   - Overview of the workflow
   - Stages/phases
   - Jobs and their purposes
   - Individual steps within each job
   - A mermaid diagram visualizing the workflow

   Please provide the workflow content so I can analyze it for you!
